🧠 One thing I've learned along the way:
**You can't automate everything — but you can always optimize.**
And that’s exactly what I love doing.

## What I Do
🧪 Build robust, maintainable test automation solutions for web applications

🌐 Specialize in E2E GUI testing using Cypress and Playwright

🔁 Experienced in API testing with Postman and SOAP UI

⚙️ Integrate test automation into CI/CD pipelines for smooth, scalable releases

I’m always looking to improve, simplify, and automate the right things — and have fun while doing it. 🍰
